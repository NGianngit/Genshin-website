QUIZSHIN (https://ngianngit.github.io/Integrated-Project/)


This Is Quizshin. The aim of this app is to allow both Genshin Impact players and people who 
do notknow about Genshin Impact, to learn more about the game and the world that has been 
built around it.

Existing players can show off their knowledge by attempting any of the 5 quizzes available, 
each of a different subject in genshin. This will allow players to not only immerse 
themselves deeper and expand their knowledge of the wide world of Teyvat, but also introduce 
new players and non-players to the wonderful game of Genshin Impact


DESIGN PROCESS______________________________________________________________________________

This website is designed for Genshin Impact players and people interested in Genshin Impact
with the intent of increasing their immersion or to attract them to try out the game.

website as prizes are not limited to in-game rewards.

Impact
